## Motivation
With global warming leading to increased precipitation, many municipalities, especially those with water courses passing through them, are at risk of flooding. If municipalities are not prepared to handle flooding, it can lead to significant damages. This tool was created to help municipalities determine flood risk, so that they can prepare solutions before problems arise.

## Goals
The goals of this tool are to process inundation, flow velocity and land use into a single general flood risk raster, allowing for a
simple overview of the areas in a municipality that are at the highest risk of flooding. Programmatically, the goals of this project are
to develop a better understanding of Python and how to manage geospatial data.
